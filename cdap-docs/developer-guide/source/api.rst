HTTP RESTful API
----------------

Introduction
============

The Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) has an HTTP interface for a multitude of purposes:

- **Stream:** sending data events to a Stream or to inspect the contents of a Stream
- **Dataset:** interacting with Datasets, Dataset Modules, and Dataset Types
- **Query:** sending ad-hoc queries to CDAP Datasets
- **Procedure:** sending calls to a stored Procedure
- **Client:** deploying and managing Applications and managing the life cycle of Flows,
  Procedures, MapReduce Jobs, Workflows, and Custom Services
- **Logging:** retrieving Application logs
- **Metrics:** retrieving metrics for system and user Applications (user-defined metrics)
- **Monitor:** checking the status of various System and Custom CDAP services

Conventions
-----------

In this API, *client* refers to an external application that is calling CDAP using the HTTP interface.
*Application* refers to a user Application that has been deployed into CDAP.

All URLs referenced in this API have this base URL::

  http://<host>:<port>/v2

where ``<host>`` is the host name of the CDAP server and ``<port>`` is the port that is set as the ``router.bind.port``
in ``cdap-site.xml`` (default: ``10000``).

**Note:** If SSL is enabled for CDAP, then the base URL uses ``https`` and ``<port>`` becomes the port that is set
as the ``router.ssl.bind.port`` in ``cdap-site.xml`` (default: 10443).

In this API, the base URL is represented as::

  <base-url>

For example::

  PUT <base-url>/streams/<new-stream-id>

means
::

  PUT http://<host>:<port>/v2/streams/<new-stream-id>
  

Text that are variables that you are to replace is indicated by a series of angle brackets (``< >``). For example::

  PUT <base-url>/streams/<new-stream-id>

indicates that—in addition to the ``<base-url>``—the text ``<new-stream-id>`` is a variable
and that you are to replace it with your value, perhaps in this case *mystream*::

  PUT <base-url>/streams/mystream

Status Codes
------------

`Common status codes <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html>`__ returned for all HTTP calls:


.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 30 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Code
     - Description
     - Explanation
   * - ``200``
     - ``OK``
     - The request returned successfully
   * - ``400``
     - ``Bad Request``
     - The request had a combination of parameters that is not recognized
   * - ``401``
     - ``Unauthorized``
     - The request did not contain an authentication token
   * - ``403``
     - ``Forbidden``
     - The request was authenticated but the client does not have permission
   * - ``404``
     - ``Not Found``
     - The request did not address any of the known URIs
   * - ``405``
     - ``Method Not Allowed``
     - A request was received with a method not supported for the URI
   * - ``409``
     - ``Conflict``
     - A request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current resource state
   * - ``500``
     - ``Internal Server Error``
     - An internal error occurred while processing the request
   * - ``501``
     - ``Not Implemented``
     - A request contained a query that is not supported by this API

**Note:** These returned status codes are not necessarily included in the descriptions of the API,
but a request may return any of these.


Working with CDAP Security
--------------------------
When working with a CDAP cluster with security enabled (``security.enabled=true`` in
``cdap-site.xml``), all calls to the HTTP RESTful APIs must be authenticated. Clients must first
obtain an access token from the authentication server (see the *Client Authentication* section of the
Developer Guide :ref:`CDAP Security. <security>`).
In order to authenticate, all client requests must supply this access token in the
``Authorization`` header of the request::

   Authorization: Bearer <token>

For CDAP-issued access tokens, the authentication scheme must always be ``Bearer``.

.. _rest-streams:

Stream HTTP API
===============
This interface supports creation of a Stream; sending, reading, and truncating events to and from a Stream; and setting the TTL property of a Stream.

Streams may have multiple consumers (for example, multiple Flows), each of which may be a group of different agents (for example, multiple instances of a Flowlet).


Creating a Stream
-----------------
A Stream can be created with an HTTP PUT method to the URL::

  PUT <base-url>/streams/<new-stream-id>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<new-stream-id>``
     - Name of the Stream to be created

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event either successfully created a Stream or the Stream already exists

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``PUT <base-url>/streams/mystream``
   * - Description
     - Create a new Stream named *mystream*

Comments
........
- The ``<new-stream-id>`` should only contain ASCII letters, digits and hyphens.
- If the Stream already exists, no error is returned, and the existing Stream remains in place.

Sending Events to a Stream
--------------------------
An event can be sent to a Stream by sending an HTTP POST method to the URL of the Stream::

  POST <base-url>/streams/<stream-id>

In cases where it is acceptable to have some events lost, events can be transmitted asynchronously to a Stream with higher throughput by sending an HTTP POST method to the ``async`` URL::

  POST <base-url>/streams/<stream-id>/async

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<stream-id>``
     - Name of an existing Stream

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event was successfully received and persisted
   * - ``202 ACCEPTED``
     - The event was successfully received but may not be persisted. Only the asynchronous endpoint will return this status code
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The Stream does not exist


Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``POST <base-url>/streams/mystream``
   * - Description
     - Send an event to the existing Stream named *mystream*

Comments
........
You can pass headers for the event as HTTP headers by prefixing them with the *stream-id*::

  <stream-id>.<property>:<string value>

After receiving the request, the HTTP handler transforms it into a Stream event:

- The body of the event is an identical copy of the bytes found in the body of the HTTP post request.
- If the request contains any headers prefixed with the *stream-id*,
  the *stream-id* prefix is stripped from the header name and
  the header is added to the event.

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Reading Events from a Stream
----------------------------
Reading events from an existing Stream is performed with an HTTP GET method to the URL::

  GET <base-url>/streams/<stream-id>/events?start=<startTime>&end=<endTime>&limit=<limit>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<stream-id>``
     - Name of an existing Stream
   * - ``<startTime>``
     - Optional timestamp in milliseconds to start reading events from (inclusive); default is 0
   * - ``<endTime>``
     - Optional timestamp in milliseconds for the last event to read (exclusive); default is the maximum timestamp (2^63)
   * - ``<limit>``
     - Optional maximum number of events to read; default is unlimited

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event was successfully received and the result of the read was returned
   * - ``204 No Content``
     - The Stream exists but there are no events that satisfy the request
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The Stream does not exist

The response body is a JSON array with the Stream event objects as array elements::

   [ 
     {"timestamp" : ... , "headers": { ... }, "body" : ... }, 
     {"timestamp" : ... , "headers": { ... }, "body" : ... } 
   ]

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
   * - ``timestamp``
     - Timestamp in milliseconds of the Stream event at ingestion time
   * - ``headers``
     - A JSON map of all custom headers associated with the Stream event
   * - ``body``
     - A printable string representing the event body; non-printable bytes are hex escaped in the format ``\x[hex-digit][hex-digit]``, e.g. ``\x05``

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``GET <base-url>/streams/mystream/events?limit=1``

Truncating a Stream
-------------------
Truncating means deleting all events that were ever written to the Stream.
This is permanent and cannot be undone.
A Stream can be truncated with an HTTP POST method to the URL::

  POST <base-url>/streams/<stream-id>/truncate

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<stream-id>``
     - Name of an existing Stream

HTTP Responses

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The Stream was successfully truncated
   * - ``404 Not Found``

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``POST <base-url>/streams/mystream/truncate``
   * - Description
     - Delete all events in the Stream named *mystream*

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Setting Time-To-Live Property of a Stream
-----------------------------------------
The Time-To-Live (TTL) property governs how long an event is valid for consumption since 
it was written to the Stream.
The default TTL for all Streams is infinite, meaning that events will never expire.
The TTL property of a Stream can be changed with an HTTP PUT method to the URL::

  PUT <base-url>/streams/<stream-id>/config

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<stream-id>``
     - Name of an existing Stream

The new TTL value is passed in the request body as::

  { "ttl" : <ttl-in-seconds> }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<ttl-in-seconds>``
     - Number of seconds that an event will be valid for since ingested

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The stream TTL was changed successfully
   * - ``400 Bad Request``
     - The TTL value is not a non-negative integer
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The Stream does not exist

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``PUT <base-url>/streams/mystream/config``

       with the new TTL value as a JSON string in the body::

         { "ttl" : 86400 }
     
   * - Description
     - Change the TTL property of the Stream named *mystream* to 1 day

Query HTTP API
==============

This interface supports submitting SQL queries over Datasets. Queries are
processed asynchronously; to obtain query results, perform these steps:

- first, **submit** the query;
- then poll for the query's **status** until it is finished;
- once finished, retrieve the **result schema** and the **results**;
- finally, **close the query** to free the resources that it holds.

Submitting a Query
------------------
To submit a SQL query, post the query string to the ``queries`` URL::

  POST <base-url>/data/explore/queries

The body of the request must contain a JSON string of the form::

  {
    "query": "<SQL-query-string>"
  }

where ``<SQL-query-string>`` is the actual SQL query.

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The query execution was successfully initiated, and the body will contain the query-handle
       used to identify the query in subsequent requests
   * - ``400 Bad Request``
     - The query is not well-formed or contains an error, such as a nonexistent table name.

Comments
........
If the query execution was successfully initiated, the body will contain a handle 
used to identify the query in subsequent requests::

  { "handle":"<query-handle>" }

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Request
     - ``PUT <base-url>/data/explore/queries``
   * - Body
     - ``{"query":"SELECT * FROM cdap_user_mydataset LIMIT 5"}``
   * - HTTP Response
     - ``{"handle":"57cf1b01-8dba-423a-a8b4-66cd29dd75e2"}``
   * - Description
     - Submit a query to get the first 5 entries from the Dataset, *mydataset*

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Status of a Query
-----------------
The status of a query is obtained using a HTTP GET request to the query's URL::

  GET <base-url>/data/explore/queries/<query-handle>/status

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<query-handle>``
     - Handle obtained when the query was submitted

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The query exists and the body contains its status
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The query handle does not match any current query.

Comments
........
If the query exists, the body will contain the status of its execution
and whether the query has a results set::

  {
    "status":"<status-code>",
    "hasResults":<boolean>
   }

Status can be one of the following: ``INITIALIZED``, ``RUNNING``, ``FINISHED``, ``CANCELED``, ``CLOSED``,
``ERROR``, ``UNKNOWN``, and ``PENDING``.

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Request

   * - HTTP Response
     - ``{"status":"FINISHED","hasResults":true}``
   * - Description
     - Retrieve the status of the query which has the handle 57cf1b01-8dba-423a-a8b4-66cd29dd75e2


Obtaining the Result Schema
---------------------------
If the query's status is ``FINISHED`` and it has results, you can obtain the schema of the results::

  GET <base-url>/data/explore/queries/<query-handle>/schema

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<query-handle>``
     - Handle obtained when the query was submitted

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The query was successfully received and the query schema was returned in the body
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The query handle does not match any current query

Comments
........
The query's result schema is returned in a JSON body as a list of columns,
each given by its name, type and position; if the query has no result set, this list is empty::

  [
    {"name":"<name>", "type":"<type>", "position":<int>},
    ...
  ]

The type of each column is a data type as defined in the `Hive language manual
<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL>`_.

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

     - ``[{"name":"cdap_user_mydataset.key","type":"array<tinyint>","position":1},``
       ``{"name":"cdap_user_mydataset.value","type":"array<tinyint>","position":2}]``
   * - Description
     - Retrieve the schema of the result of the query which has the handle 57cf1b01-8dba-423a-a8b4-66cd29dd75e2


Retrieving Query Results
------------------------
Query results can be retrieved in batches after the query is finished, optionally specifying the batch
size in the body of the request::

  POST <base-url>/data/explore/queries/<query-handle>/next

The body of the request can contain a JSON string specifying the batch size::

  {
    "size":<int>
  }

If the batch size is not specified, the default is 20.

     - The query handle does not match any current query

Comments
........
The results are returned in a JSON body as a list of columns,
each given as a structure containing a list of column values.::

  [
    { "columns": [ <value_1>, <value_2>, ..., ] },
    ...
  ]

The value at each position has the type that was returned in the result schema for that position.
For example, if the returned type was ``INT``, then the value will be an integer literal,
whereas for ``STRING`` or ``VARCHAR`` the value will be a string literal.

Repeat the query to retrieve subsequent results. If all results of the query have already 
been retrieved, then the returned list is empty.

.. _cdap-client-http-api:

CDAP Client HTTP API
====================

Use the CDAP Client HTTP API to deploy or delete Applications and manage the life cycle of 
Flows, Procedures, MapReduce jobs, Workflows, and Custom Services.

Deploy an Application
---------------------
To deploy an Application from your local file system, submit an HTTP POST request::

  POST <base-url>/apps

with the name of the JAR file as a header::

  X-Archive-Name: <JAR filename>

and its content as the body of the request::

  <JAR binary content>

Invoke the same command to update an Application to a newer version.
However, be sure to stop all of its Flows, Procedures and MapReduce jobs before updating the Application.

To list all of the deployed applications, issue an HTTP GET request::

  GET <base-url>/apps

This will return a JSON String map that lists each Application with its name and description.

Details of A Deployed Application
---------------------------------

For detailed information on an application that has been deployed, use::

  GET <base-url>/apps/<app-id>

The information will be returned in the body of the response.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<app-id>``
     - Name of the Application

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event successfully called the method, and the body contains the results

Delete an Application
---------------------
To delete an Application together with all of its Flows, Procedures and MapReduce jobs, submit an HTTP DELETE::

  DELETE <base-url>/apps/<application-name>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<application-name>``
     - Name of the Application to be deleted

**Note:** The ``<application-name>`` in this URL is the name of the Application
as configured by the Application Specification,
and not necessarily the same as the name of the JAR file that was used to deploy the Application.
Also, this does not delete the Streams and Datasets associated with the Application
because they belong to your account, not the Application.

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Start, Stop, Status, and Runtime Arguments
------------------------------------------
After an Application is deployed, you can start and stop its Flows, Procedures, MapReduce 
jobs, Workflows, and Custom Services, and query for their status using HTTP POST and GET methods::

  POST <base-url>/apps/<app-id>/<element-type>/<element-id>/<operation>
  GET <base-url>/apps/<app-id>/<element-type>/<element-id>/status

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<app-id>``
     - Name of the Application being called
   * - ``<element-type>``
     - One of ``flows``, ``procedures``, ``mapreduce``, ``workflows`` or ``services``
   * - ``<element-id>``
     - Name of the element (*Flow*, *Procedure*, *MapReduce*, *Workflow*, or *Custom Service*)
       being called
   * - ``<operation>``
     - One of ``start`` or ``stop``

You can retrieve the status of multiple elements from different applications and element types
using an HTTP POST method::

  POST <base-url>/status

with a JSON array in the request body consisting of multiple JSON objects with these parameters:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``"appId"``
     - Name of the Application being called
   * - ``"programType"``
     - One of ``flow``, ``procedure``, ``mapreduce``, ``workflow`` or ``service``
   * - ``"programId"``
     - Name of the element (*Flow*, *Procedure*, *MapReduce*, *Workflow*, or *Custom Service*)
       being called

The response will be the same JSON array with additional parameters for each of the underlying JSON objects:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``"status"``
     - Maps to the status of an individual JSON object's queried element
       if the query is valid and the element was found.
   * - ``"statusCode"``
     - The status code from retrieving the status of an individual JSON object.
   * - ``"error"``
     - If an error, a description of why the status was not retrieved (the specified element was not found, etc.)

The ``status`` and ``error`` fields are mutually exclusive meaning if there is an error,
then there will never be a status and vice versa.

Examples

   * -
     - Try to get the status of the Flow *MyFlow* in the Application *MyApp* and of the Procedure *MyProcedure*
       in the Application *MyApp2*

When starting an element, you can optionally specify runtime arguments as a JSON map in the request body::

  POST <base-url>/apps/HelloWorld/flows/WhoFlow/start

with the arguments as a JSON string in the body::

  {"foo":"bar","this":"that"}

CDAP will use these these runtime arguments only for this single invocation of the
element. To save the runtime arguments so that CDAP will use them every time you start the element,
issue an HTTP PUT with the parameter ``runtimeargs``::

  PUT <base-url>/apps/HelloWorld/flows/WhoFlow/runtimeargs

with the arguments as a JSON string in the body::

  {"foo":"bar","this":"that"}

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

To retrieve the runtime arguments saved for an Application's element, issue an HTTP GET 
request to the element's URL using the same parameter ``runtimeargs``::

  GET <base-url>/apps/HelloWorld/flows/WhoFlow/runtimeargs

This will return the saved runtime arguments in JSON format.

Container Information
---------------------

To find out the address of an element's container host and the container’s debug port, you can query
CDAP for a Procedure, Flow or Service’s live info via an HTTP GET method::

  GET <base-url>/apps/<app-id>/<element-type>/<element-id>/live-info

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<app-id>``
     - Name of the Application being called
   * - ``<element-type>``
     - One of ``flows``, ``procedures`` or ``services``
   * - ``<element-id>``
     - Name of the element (*Flow*, *Procedure* or *Custom Service*)

Example::

  GET <base-url>/apps/WordCount/flows/WordCounter/live-info

   * - ``"runnableId"``
     - Name of the *Flowlet* or *Service* if querying either a *Flow* or *User Service*. This parameter
       does not apply to *Procedures* because the ``programId`` is the same as the ``runnableId`` for a *Procedure*

The response will be the same JSON array with additional parameters for each of the underlying JSON objects:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``"requested"``
     - Number of instances the user requested for the program defined by the individual JSON object's parameters

.. _loggingHTTP:

Logging HTTP API
================

Downloading Logs
----------------
Logs emitted by any of the *Flows*, *Procedures*, *MapReduce* jobs, or
*Services* running in CDAP can be downloaded with the Logging HTTP API. To do
that, send an HTTP GET request::

  GET <base-url>/apps/<app-id>/<element-type>/<element-id>/logs?start=<ts>&stop=<ts>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<app-id>``
     - Name of the Application being called
   * - ``<element-type>``
     - One of ``flows``, ``procedures``, ``mapreduce``, or ``services``
   * - ``<element-id>``
     - Name of the element (*Flow*, *Procedure*, *MapReduce* job, *Service*) being called
   * - ``<ts>``
     - *Start* and *stop* times, given as seconds since the start of the Epoch.

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``GET <base-url>/apps/WordCount/flows/WordCountFlow/``
       ``logs?start=1382576400&stop=1382576700``
   * - Description
     - Return the logs for all the events from the Flow *WordCountFlow* of the *WordCount*
       Application,
       beginning ``Thu, 24 Oct 2013 01:00:00 GMT`` and
       ending ``Thu, 24 Oct 2013 01:05:00 GMT`` (five minutes later)

Comments
........
The output is formatted as HTML-embeddable text; that is, characters that have a special meaning in HTML will be
escaped. A line of the log may look like this::

  2013-10-23 18:03:09,793 - INFO [FlowletProcessDriver-source-0-
        executor:c.c.e.c.StreamSource@-1] – source: Emitting line: this is an &amp; character

**Note:** The context of the log line shows the name of the Flowlet (*source*), its instance number (0) as
well as the original line in the Application code. The character *&* is escaped as ``&amp;``; if you don’t desire
this escaping, you can turn it off by adding the parameter ``&escape=false`` to the request URL.

.. _metricsHTTP:

Metrics HTTP API
================
As Applications process data, CDAP collects metrics about the Application’s behavior and performance. Some of these
metrics are the same for every Application—how many events are processed, how many data operations are performed,
etc.—and are thus called system or CDAP metrics.

.. rst2pdf: CutStart

.. only:: html

   Other metrics are user-defined and differ from Application to Application. 
   For details on how to add metrics to your Application, see the section on User-Defined Metrics in the
   the Developer Guide, :ref:`CDAP Operations Guide. <admin>`

Metrics Requests
----------------
The general form of a metrics request is::

  GET <base-url>/metrics/<scope>/<context>/<metric>?<time-range>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter

   * - ``<metric>``
     - Metric being queried; see `Available Metrics`_
   * - ``<time-range>``
     - A `Time Range`_ or ``aggregate=true`` for all since the Application was deployed

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``GET <base-url>/metrics/system/apps/HelloWorld/flows/``

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``GET <base-url>/metrics/user/apps/HelloWorld/services/``
       ``WhoService/runnables/WhoRun/names.bytes?aggregate=true``
   * - Description
     - Using a *User-Defined* metric, *names.bytes* in a Service's Handler

Comments
........
The scope must be either ``system`` for system metrics or ``user`` for user-defined metrics.

System metrics are either Application metrics (about Applications and their Flows, Procedures, MapReduce and Workflows) or they are Data metrics (relating to Streams or Datasets).

User metrics are always in the Application context.

For example, to retrieve the number of input data objects (“events”) processed by a Flowlet named *splitter*,
in the Flow *CountRandomFlow* of the Application *CountRandom*, over the last 5 seconds, you can issue an HTTP
GET method::

  GET <base-url>/metrics/system/apps/CountRandom/flows/CountRandomFlow/flowlets/
          splitter/process.events.processed?start=now-5s&count=5

This returns a JSON response that has one entry for every second in the requested time interval. It will have
values only for the times where the metric was actually emitted (shown here "pretty-printed")::

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json
  {"start":1382637108,"end":1382637112,"data":[
  {"time":1382637108,"value":6868},
  {"time":1382637109,"value":6895},
  {"time":1382637110,"value":6856},
  {"time":1382637111,"value":6816},
  {"time":1382637112,"value":6765}]}

If you want the number of input objects processed across all Flowlets of a Flow, you address the metrics
API at the Flow context::

  GET <base-url>/metrics/system/apps/CountRandom/flows/
    CountRandomFlow/process.events.processed?start=now-5s&count=5

Similarly, you can address the context of all flows of an Application, an entire Application, or the entire CDAP::

  GET <base-url>/metrics/system/apps/CountRandom/
    flows/process.events.processed?start=now-5s&count=5
  GET <base-url>/metrics/system/apps/CountRandom/
    process.events.processed?start=now-5s&count=5
  GET <base-url>/metrics/system/process.events?start=now-5s&count=5

To request user-defined metrics instead of system metrics, specify ``user`` instead of ``cdap`` in the URL
and specify the user-defined metric at the end of the request.

For example, to request a user-defined metric for the *HelloWorld* Application's *WhoFlow* Flow::

  GET <base-url>/metrics/user/apps/HelloWorld/flows/
    WhoFlow/flowlets/saver/names.bytes?aggregate=true

To retrieve multiple metrics at once, instead of a GET, issue an HTTP POST, with a JSON list as the request body that enumerates the name and attributes for each metrics. For example::

  POST <base-url>/metrics

with the arguments as a JSON string in the body::

  Content-Type: application/json
  [ "/system/collect.events?aggregate=true",
  "/system/apps/HelloWorld/process.events.processed?start=1380323712&count=6000" ]

If the context of the requested metric or metric itself doesn't exist the system returns status 200 (OK) with JSON formed as per above description and with values being zeroes.

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Time Range
----------
The time range of a metric query can be specified in various ways:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Time Range
     - Description
   * - ``start=now-30s&end=now``
     - The last 30 seconds. The begin time is given in seconds relative to the current time.
       You can apply simple math, using ``now`` for the current time, 
       ``s`` for seconds, ``m`` for minutes, ``h`` for hours and ``d`` for days. 
       For example: ``now-5d-12h`` is 5 days and 12 hours ago.
   * - ``start=1385625600&`` ``end=1385629200``
     - From ``Thu, 28 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT`` to ``Thu, 28 Nov 2013 09:00:00 GMT``,
       both given as since the start of the Epoch
   * - ``start=1385625600&`` ``count=3600``
     - The same as before, but with the count given as a number of seconds

Instead of getting the values for each second of a time range, you can also retrieve the
aggregate of a metric over time. The following request will return the total number of input objects processed since the Application *CountRandom* was deployed, assuming that CDAP has not been stopped or restarted (you cannot specify a time range for aggregates)::

  GET <base-url>/metrics/system/apps/CountRandom/process.events.processed?aggregate=true

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Available Contexts
------------------
The context of a metric is typically enclosed into a hierarchy of contexts. For example, the Flowlet context is enclosed in the Flow context, which in turn is enclosed in the Application context. A metric can always be queried (and aggregated) relative to any enclosing context. These are the available Application contexts of CDAP:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - System Metric
     - Context
   * - One Flowlet of a Flow
     - ``/apps/<app-id>/flows/<flow-id>/flowlets/<flowlet-id>``
   * - All Flowlets of a Flow
     - ``/apps/<app-id>/flows/<flow-id>``
   * - All Flowlets of all Flows of an Application
     - ``/apps/<app-id>/flows``
   * - One Procedure
     - ``/apps/<app-id>/procedures/<procedure-id>``

     - ``/apps/<app-id>/services``
   * - All elements of an Application
     - ``/apps/<app-id>``
   * - All elements of all Applications
     - ``/``

Stream metrics are only available at the Stream level and the only available context is:

   :widths: 30 70

   * - Stream Metric
     - Context
   * - A single Stream
     - ``/streams/<stream-id>``

Dataset metrics are available at the Dataset level, but they can also be queried down to the
Flowlet, Procedure, Mapper, or Reducer level:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Dataset Metric
     - Context
   * - A single Dataset in the context of a single Flowlet

   * - A single Dataset in the context of a single Flow
     - ``/datasets/<dataset-id>/apps/<app-id>/flows/<flow-id>``
   * - A single Dataset in the context of a specific Application
     - ``/datasets/<dataset-id>/<any application context>``
   * - A single Dataset across all Applications
     - ``/datasets/<dataset-id>``
   * - All Datasets across all Applications
     - ``/``

.. _CLI:

----------------------
Command-Line Interface
----------------------

Introduction
============

The Command-Line Interface (CLI) provides methods to interact with the CDAP server from within a shell,
similar to HBase shell or ``bash``. It is located within the SDK, at ``bin/cdap-cli`` as either a bash
script or a Windows ``.bat`` file.

The CLI may be used in two ways: interactive mode and non-interactive mode.

Interactive Mode
----------------

.. highlight:: console

To run the CLI in interactive mode, run the ``cdap-cli.sh`` executable with no arguments from the terminal::

  $ /bin/cdap-cli.sh

or, on Windows::

  ~SDK> bin\cdap-cli.bat

The executable should bring you into a shell, with this prompt::

  cdap (http://localhost:10000)>

This indicates that the CLI is currently set to interact with the CDAP server at ``localhost``.
There are two ways to interact with a different CDAP server:

- To interact with a different CDAP server by default, set the environment variable ``CDAP_HOST`` to a hostname.
- To change the current CDAP server, run the command ``connect example.com``.
- To connect to an SSL-enabled CDAP server, run the command ``connect https://example.com``.

For example, with ``CDAP_HOST`` set to ``example.com``, the CLI would be interacting with
a CDAP instance at ``example.com``, port ``10000``::

  cdap (http://example.com:10000)>

To list all of the available commands, enter ``help``::

  cdap (http://localhost:10000)> help

Non-Interactive Mode
--------------------

To run the CLI in non-interactive mode, run the ``cdap-cli.sh`` executable, passing the command you want executed
as the argument. For example, to list all applications currently deployed to CDAP, execute::

  cdap-cli.sh list apps

Connecting to Secure CDAP Instances
-----------------------------------

When connecting to secure CDAP instances, the CLI will look for an access token located at
~/.cdap.accesstoken.<hostname> and use it if it exists and is valid. If not, the CLI will prompt
you for the required credentials to acquire an access token from the CDAP instance. Once acquired,
the CLI will save it to ~/.cdap.accesstoken.<hostname> for later use and use it for the rest of
the current CLI session.
